Download
--------

You can get the latest official release on SFML website (http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml.net).
You can also get the current development version from the git repository (https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net).

Learn
-----

There is no tutorial for SFML.Net, but since it's a binding you can use the C++ resources:
* The official tutorials (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/)
* The online API documentation (http://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/)
* The community wiki (https://github.com/SFML/SFML/wiki/)
* The community forum (http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/) (or http://fr.sfml-dev.org/forums/ for French people)

Of course, you can also find the SFML.Net API documentation in the SDK.

Dependencies
--------

To run SFML.NET executables you must have a copy of CSFML. CSFML can be compiled from
source (https://github.com/SFML/CSFML/) or downloaded from the offical release
page (http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/). Also note that since CSFML depends on
the main SFML project you also need all SFML runtime dependencies.

Another dependency is the OpenTK library. This is required by the examples to run correctly.
It is not required unless you plan on running the example programs that are included.
